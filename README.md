## My process

> I looked into the design first to come up with a solution on how to implement it into code
> after which I decided to start the process by structuring the content with HTML, and
> linking the necessary assets to be used on the project such as the font from google fonts [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit]
> I also decided to work with SASS since I find it really helpful and make my process easier when it comes to writing css.
> The structure that I made for the content is that the main component is inside a div container then inside the container is the component
> inside the component are 2 div containers the first one is for the qr image, and the second is for the texts and inside it are two
> elements 1 of which is the h1 for the title and a p for the description.
> After I'm done with structuring the content, I proceeded to making the desing, I followed the design layout from the resources and then
> I started with making the base of the design such as the font-sizes, colors, widths, and heights of the components.
> I continued with the process and finished it.

### Continued development

- Use of flex-box for layouts and such.
- Having reusable classes and choosing what reusable classes to make.
- Design making
